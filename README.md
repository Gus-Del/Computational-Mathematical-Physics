Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Computational physics is a multidisciplinary field that uses numerical analysis and algorithms to solve complex problems in physics that are difficult or impossible to tackle with traditional analytical methods. It combines principles from theoretical physics, mathematics, and computer science, enabling researchers to simulate, visualize, and analyze phenomena across various scales—from subatomic particles to galaxies.

At its core, computational physics focuses on developing and applying computational techniques to solve equations that describe physical systems, such as the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, or Einstein’s field equations in general relativity. These simulations often require vast computational resources and can model phenomena ranging from the behavior of electrons in materials to the evolution of stars and galaxies.

The field leverages advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics, and finite element methods, to study systems with many degrees of freedom, stochastic behaviors, or nonlinear dynamics. Modern computational physics also embraces high-performance computing (HPC) and parallel processing to accelerate the solving of large-scale problems, while also contributing to advancements in software and hardware optimizations.

Applications of computational physics are vast and include condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and climate modeling, among others. The methods developed in computational physics are often transferable to other fields like engineering and biology, making it a critical area for innovation and discovery in the 21st century. This repository, "Computational Physics," aims to provide tools, algorithms, and projects to advance the understanding and application of computational techniques in physics.
